Advantages of React
Declarative: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. By designing simple views for each state in your application, React efficiently updates and renders the right components when your data changes.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Learn Once, Write Anywhere: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
