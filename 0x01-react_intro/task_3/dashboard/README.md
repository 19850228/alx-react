Key Features of React
Component-Based Architecture:

Components are the building blocks of a React application. A component in React can be a class or a function that returns a React element (JSX) that describes how a section of the UI should appear.
Components can be reused throughout the application, which makes it easier to manage and develop complex UIs.
JSX (JavaScript XML):

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows developers to write HTML elements directly within JavaScript code.
It makes the code easier to read and write, and allows the use of JavaScript expressions within HTML.
Virtual DOM:

React maintains a lightweight representation of the real DOM in memory, known as the Virtual DOM.
When the state of a component changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, calculates the difference between the previous and current versions, and then efficiently updates the real DOM with only the necessary changes.
One-way Data Binding:

React uses one-way data binding, meaning the data flows in a single direction, from parent to child components.
This makes it easier to understand and debug the flow of data in an application.
State and Props:

State is a JavaScript object that holds dynamic data and determines how the component renders and behaves. Each component can have its own state.
Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from parent to child components. They allow components to communicate with each other.
Lifecycle Methods:

React components go through a lifecycle, and you can hook into specific phases of this lifecycle using lifecycle methods.
Examples of lifecycle methods include componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
Hooks:

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
Common hooks include useState, useEffect, and useContext.
